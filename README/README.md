# Introduction

This application is named Job Hunt. It was built with the intent of helping users keep track of their progress as they go through the process of finding a job.

### Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Heroku,

dotenv, express, ckeditor5

### Getting Started

Link to application https://jonhuntapp.herokuapp.com/viewHunts

The first thing a user must do is login or sign up for the application. Without doing either of those two, users will note have access to the full functionality of the app.

Once a user is logged in, they will have access to create a job hunt via links in the nav. Each hunt a user creates is like a folder which holds all the progress for the Job they are hoping to get. 

Once a hunt is created it can be selected or deleted. 

When a hunt is selected, via links in the nav a user will now have access to creating a job of interest, delete, edit and view that job of interest. They will be able to create, store, view, edit and delete jobs they have applied for. They will be able create, edit and delete; interviews they are currently in the progress of. They will be able to create, store, edit, delete accept, and decline offers they have received. And at the end of it all they will also be provided a summary of their progress. 

 ### Next Step

In an attempt to enhance the user's experience and to have a more meaninful app, a resume feature will be add to the app, just so users can store their reusume in the hunt of their choosing. It has also be planned to intergrate the application with an api just so users will have the abilty to find and stroll through jobs of interest all from the application.


























### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
